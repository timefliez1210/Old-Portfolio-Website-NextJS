          [...] Clemens Fabig has been working for us as an independent
          freelancer since 2019 and has some Commissioned work carried out. The
          focus was on the development of databases using mysql, programming
          based on Java and JavaScript, and project work using Django.
          <br />
          Mr. Fabig identified himself strongly with the responsibility assumed
          and drove it on assigned tasks always very committed and with a lot of
          initiative. Even under permanent considerable workload and in view of
          new programming challenges Mr. Fabig always had an overview and set
          the right priorities. [...]
